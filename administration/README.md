# Administration

This section contains information that is useful for Launch administrators.

*   **[User Management](user-management.md)**
    This topic describes the user management process and available rights.
*   **[Companies and Properties](properties.md)**
    A property, or web property, is a collection of rules, data elements, configured extensions, environments, and libraries. There is only one publish embed code per property.
*   **[Adapter](adapter.md)**
    When you create a build, Launch delivers that build to a location determined by the adapter assigned to the environment.
*   **[Environment](environment-overview.md)**
    An _environment_ is a destination for deployment. An environment has a 1:1 relationship with an embed code.
*   **[Link DTM Embed Code to Launch](embed-code-link.md)**
    When you link your DTM embed code to Launch, you can keep your DTM production embed code on a page, but serve Launch files there instead of DTM.
